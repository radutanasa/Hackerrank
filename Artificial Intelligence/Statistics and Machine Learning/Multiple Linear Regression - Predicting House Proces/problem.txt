Charlie wants to buy a house. He does a detailed survey of the houses in the area, and tries to quantify a lot of factors, such as the distance of the houses from commercial areas, schools and workplaces; the reputation of the construction companies and builders involved in constructing the apartments; the distance of the houses from highways, freeways and important roads; the size of the house; the facilities offered by the complex, and so on.

Each of these factors are quantified, normalized and mapped to values on a scale of 0 to 1. Charlie then makes a table. Each row in the table corresponds to Charlie's observations for a particular house. If Charlie has observed and noted F features, the row contains F comma separated values, followed by the house price in dollars per square foot at the end. If Charlie makes observations for H houses, his observation table has (F+1) columns and H rows, and a total of (F+1) * H entries.

Unfortunately, he was not able to get the pricing of some houses and he wants your help to give out an estimate of the pricing of the house.
There is one important observation which Charlie has made. The prices per square foot, are (approximately) a linear function of the features in the observation table. For the purpose of prediction, you need to figure out this linear function.
