Filter a given array of integers and leave only that values which are less than a specified value X. The integers in the output should be in the same sequence as they were in the input. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature for the languages mentioned below. For the rest of the languages you have to write complete code. The purpose of this challenge is to learn how to write your own implementation of filter function. We recommend to not use the inbuilt library function.
