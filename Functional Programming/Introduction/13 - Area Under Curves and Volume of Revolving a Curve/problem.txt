Definite Integrals via Numerical Methods
This relates to definite integration via numerical methods.
Consider the algebraic expression given by:
(a1)xb1 + (a2)xb2 + (a3)xb3 ......(an)xbn
For the purpose of numerical computation, the area under the curve y = f(x) between the limits a and b can be computed by the Limit Definition of a Definite Integral.
Using equal Sub-Intervals of length = 0.001, you need to
    1. Evaluate the area bounded by a given polynomial function of the kind described above, between given limits L and R.
    2. Evaluate the volume of the solid obtained by revolving this polynomial curve around the X-Axis.
An absolute error margin of 0.02 will be tolerated.
