The Euclidean Technique for Computing the GCD of two integers
Given two integers 'x' and 'y' a recursive technique to find their GCD is the Euclidean Algorithm.
This Algorithm tells us that, for computing the GCD of two positive integers x and y, if x and y are equal, GCD(x,y) = x, otherwise GCD(x,y) = GCD(x-y,y) if x > y. There are a few optimizations that can be made to the above logic, to arrive at a more efficient implementation.
